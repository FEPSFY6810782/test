  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
An increase in angle of attack of a planes’ wings results in an increase in both lift and induced drag (skybrary.aero, n.d.). If the angle of attack is too steep, the airflow across the upper surface of the aerofoil gets disconnected. This results in the airflow around the wing not being laminar (Al Bowers, 2011) resulting in a loss of lift, also known as stalling. The angle at which relative wind strikes an aerofoil is known as the angle of attack. The relative velocity between the aeroplane and the atmosphere is represented by the angle created by the aerofoil's chord and the relative wind direction (skybrary.aero, n.d.). By finding ways to maximise the angle of attack, we can reduce the time taken for take-off and landing which would reduce the fuel consumption as a huge amount of fuel is needed for that part of the journey.

Over time, the design of planes’ wings have changed to increase lift and reduce the amount of thrust needed for flight. This is done by making the air on top of the wing move faster than the bottom (SIMSCALE, 2023). This is why the wings’ top surface is curved and the bottom is flat. Having a greater velocity of air on the top than the bottom creates a low pressure zone on top of the wing and a greater pressure on the bottom (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2017). In order to create and even greater angle the wing itself is tilted which allows for the plane to have maximum upthrust whilst burning a minute amount of fuel.

    The angle of attack of an aerofoil can be visualized by looking at the aerofoil’s cross section and the direction of oncoming wind during flight. 








A plane's angle of attack has several implications. While increasing the angle of attack results in increased lift, it also makes aeroplanes more susceptible to stalling. Stalls occur when an aeroplane fails to generate adequate lift due to a critical angle of attack (when the angle of attack is greater than the maximum angle of attack). Air will flow easily over the plane's wings, and if there is insufficient lift, i.e. the weight due to gravity is greater than the lift, the plane will fall from the sky.

From figure two we can assume the same forces also affect the aerofoil (similar to figure 1) if we link this to the theory of flight which states: Four physical forces must be carefully balanced in order for heavier-than-air flight to be possible: lift, drag, weight and thrust. (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1997). We can momentarily alter the wing's shape and angle of attack by using flaps and slacks. The chord line shifts as the flaps descend and the trailing edge moves. This results in an increase in the wing's size and angle of attack. (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1997). This allows planes to be more fuel efficient thus being more economical for the airlines as well as more environmentally friendly.
